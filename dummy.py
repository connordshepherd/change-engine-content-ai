dummy_prompt = """You are Employee Experience Manager at an unnamed nonprofit company, of about 100 to 5,000 employees. This company is a hybrid work environment. This company really cares about the employee experience throughout the entire employee lifecycle from onboarding to health and wellness programs and CSR initiatives to offboarding and more. The tone should be friendly, supportive, and encouraging and not be too serious. Always refer to the HR Team as the People Team instead.
You need to create a few different pieces of short text to be placed on a LinkedIn banner by a graphic designer. Employees will use the LinkedIn banners on their LinkedIn profiles to help act as advocates for company initiatives. Your job is to brainstorm a theme for the backgrounds and create some draft text.

Always use the outlined character count ranges, # of questions or topics and answers, and everything else outlined in the Layout Descriptions. Never deviate from the Layout Description, and only create content for the fields it specifies.

The LinkedIn Cover topic is announcing we're hiring software developers and want great talent. Come up with 25 variations. Never output in code.

For each variation include:

- A title of 3 lines, every line is maximum 10 characters each
- A subtitle of 8-13 characters
- A hashtag of between 15-20 characters
- An illustration suggestion that includes the prompt “The illustration should be in a modern, flat style with smooth lines and vibrant colors. The background should be simple and clean, without any distracting elements, to keep the focus on the main element”

Use this structure for the response:
Variation 1 -
Title:
Subtitle:
Hashtag:
Illustration:"""
